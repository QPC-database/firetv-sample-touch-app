## How to test Touch on Fire TV devices without a touchscreen

The easiest solution is to connect a wireless mouse to your Amazon Fire TV. Mouse on Android simulates touch interaction. You can do this by:

1.  Going to "Settings"
2.  Go to "Remote and Bluetooth Devices"
3.  Go to "Other Bluetooth devices"
4.  Follow the on-screen instructions on how to connect your Bluetooth mouse
5.  After connecting the mouse, go back to your app. The mouse will show a cursor on screen you can use to simulate touch interactions, including clicks and gestures.
